## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building decentralized applications and robust, user-centric solutions. I specialize in combining traditional web development with blockchain technology to create products that solve real-world problems.

- Experienced with **frontend and backend development**, blockchain smart contracts, and cloud infrastructure.
- Strong focus on **clean, maintainable code** and developer-friendly solutions.
- Always exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of web and blockchain development.

### **BlockBlind**
A prototype interface allowing users to interact with a smart contract pool through a community-managed wallet. Built with usability and simplicity in mind.

### **DataBlock**
An early-stage Rust-based blockchain indexer aimed at giving developers fast, structured, and queryable access to on-chain data across multiple chains.
